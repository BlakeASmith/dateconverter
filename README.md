# dateconverter

A tampermonkey script which adds a pop-up when timestamps or dates are selected with buttons to select. I made this because I visited https://www.epochconverter.com/ an obnoxious number of times. 

The code was gratiously written by Claude 3.7 after a few back-and-forth prompts in about 30 mins all in. Don't expect greatness. But, it's not too shabby regardless :)

For as long as I bother to host it, there is a webpage explaining the tool which has a download link https://tools.dotle.ca/dateconverter/. If it's down, use [this link](https://github.com/BlakeASmith/dateconverter/raw/refs/heads/main/public/dateconverter.user.js) to install the tampermonkey script directly from github. 

It should go without saying, but for anyone new to this -- you will need the [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) extension installed in your browser first.
