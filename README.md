# dateconverter

A tampermonkey script which adds a pop-up when timestamps or dates are selected with buttons to select. I made this because I visited https://www.epochconverter.com/ an obnoxious number of times. 

The code was gratiously written by Claude 3.7 after a few back-and-forth prompts in about 30 mins all in. Don't expect greatness. But, it's not too shabby regardless :)
